# G.I.R.L.S-Project

This projected was created by four undergraduates at West Virginia University Institute of Technology for their Software Engineering (Spring 2022) course.

We want to create an application that allows people to rate the various media they
consume, a software that can connect to others through books, movies, games, and other
media. The application will be called Graphical User Interface for Rating Literature or Such
(G.I.R.L.S.). It will allow users to catalog various items for their bookkeeping and allows them to
view others' media as well.

The application is being created with the Java programming language via Eclipse 2019. The Java Swing
toolkit is being used to build an English language GUI for the application. The application will be using the database Apache Derby to store all the usersâ€™ information.

For the purpose of this project a Java IDE is needed

To Run the program: <br />
1: Unzip the file <br />
2: Create a new project in your Java specific IDE <br />
3: Import all files into the src folder of the project <br />
4: Configure the build path of the project and add external jars (everything in the lib folder) to the classpath <br />
5: Apply and close <br />
6: Run configuration from MyLoginPage.
